description_list: '<h4>These "Double Trouble" Vivifs are unique in several ways: They
  feature eye-popping, holographic colors that drive salt water fish crazy! The 2
  eyelets allow 2 different fishing actions: a true swimbait trolling action from
  the eyelet above the mouth and a true jigging action from the eyelet above the eyes</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> The 2 Mustad hooks insure that "tail hungry" fish get a
  mouthful that keeps them caught</li><li> The 2 dorsal fins stabilize the swimming
  action and make these Vivifs run straight and true just like real live shad minnows</li><li>
  Stupendously effective on super large offshore and inland stripers and many other
  species</li></ul>'
