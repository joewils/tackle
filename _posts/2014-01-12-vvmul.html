  lots of wiggling, wobbling action</h4><ul class="description"><li> Vibrant Holographic
  colors flash and shimmer in the water</li><li> The high dorsal fin acts like a rudder
  to swim true on the retrieve</li><li> Long shank Mustad Hook secured to heavy weight
  inside for deeper countdown trolling</li><li> In addition, Vivif swimbaits are heavier
  than other swimbaits, allowing them to swim and cat better</li><li> These classic
