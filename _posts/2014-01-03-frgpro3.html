description_list: <h4>Panther Martin Pro Frogs (2) 3/8 and (1) 5/8 oz sizes</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> These surface high density frog lures are truly deadly
  on bass and pike</li><li>The new legs hold up strike after strike and mimic the
  swimming action of a wounded frog </li><li> They cast 70-90 feet, always land on
  their belly with the eyes just above the water and they can be twitched, skittered
  or "walk the dog"</li><li> Hook is down in the conventional position</li><li> This
  means you keep more of the fish that strike</li></ul>
