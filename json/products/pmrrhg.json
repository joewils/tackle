Red is a color that makes fish strike because it suggests feeding. When feeding, the gills of the fish become engorged with blood, known as \"Gill Flash\". Here we have taken Classic Regular patterns and combined them with super sharp red hooks. This deadly combination of our most popular patterns with red hooks will certainly increase your catch of fish.","category":"Classic Red Hooks","thumb_url":"http://panthermartin.com/img/Small/PMRRH_G.jpg","image_url":"http://panthermartin.com/img/Medium/PMRRH_G.jpg","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=154933&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=1071&tt=df","retail_price":"3.99","sale_price":"3.99","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=154933&amp;pri=1071\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=1197&amp;sku=PMRRH_G&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","google_categorization":"Sporting Goods > Outdoor Recreation > Fishing > Fishing Lures","variants":{"PMRRH_1_G":{"sku":"PMRRH_1_G","size":"1/32 oz.","retail_price":"3.99"},"PMRRH_15_G":{"sku":"PMRRH_15_G","size":"1/2 oz.","retail_price":"4.49"},"PMRRH_2_G":{"sku":"PMRRH_2_G","size":"1/16 oz.","retail_price":"3.99"},"PMRRH_4_G":{"sku":"PMRRH_4_G","size":"1/8 oz.","retail_price":"3.99"},"PMRRH_6_G":{"sku":"PMRRH_6_G","size":"1/4 oz.","retail_price":"3.99"},"PMRRH_9_G":{"sku":"PMRRH_9_G","size":"3/8 oz.","retail_price":"4.49"}}}
