{"sku":"4FROGH__","product_name":"4 Holographic Frog Kit","long_description":"A selection of 4 of our holographic Panther Martin Superior Frog colors in 3/8 and 5/8 oz. sixes. These surface high density frog lures are truly deadly on bass and pike. They cast 70-90 feet, always land on their belly with the eyes just above the water and they can be twitched, skittered or \"walk the dog\". Hook is down in the conventional position. This means you keep more of the fish that strike. Comes in a small re-usable tackle box that conveniently hold these great lures.","category":"Kits","thumb_url":"http://panthermartin.com/img/Small/4FROGH.jpg","image_url":"http://panthermartin.com/img/Medium/4FROGH.jpg","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=154933&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=815&tt=df","retail_price":"17.99","sale_price":"17.99","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=154933&amp;pri=815\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=1197&amp;sku=4FROGH__&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","google_categorization":"Sporting Goods > Outdoor Recreation > Fishing > Fishing Lures","variants":{"":{"retail_price":"17.99"}}}
