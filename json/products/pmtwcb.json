{"sku":"PMTW_CB","product_name":"Chrome/Black TailWagger","long_description":"A new kind of Panther Martin in flashy and hologrphic colors to catch Bass, Walleye, White Bass and Inland Stripers.  Our TailWagger tail-spinning lures are unique in that we use our famous sonic inline spinner blade with the shaft passing directly through our famous convex/concave blade. Its heavy weighted body with concave mouth increases the wobble to the body and the spinning blade sends out Panther Martin's famous sonic vibrations, calling to Bass, Walleye, White Bass and Inland Stripers.","category":"Tailwagger","thumb_url":"http://panthermartin.com/img/Small/PMTW_CB.jpg","image_url":"http://panthermartin.com/img/Medium/PMTW_CB.jpg","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=154933&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=687&tt=df","retail_price":"4.49","sale_price":"4.49","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=154933&amp;pri=687\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=1197&amp;sku=PMTW_CB&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","google_categorization":"Sporting Goods > Outdoor Recreation > Fishing > Fishing Lures","variants":{"PMTW_15_CB":{"sku":"PMTW_15_CB","size":"1/2 oz.","retail_price":"4.99"},"PMTW_9_CB":{"sku":"PMTW_9_CB","size":"3/8 oz.","retail_price":"4.49"}}}
