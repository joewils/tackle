These surface high density frog lures are truly deadly on bass and pike.The new legs hold up strike after strike and mimic the swimming action of a wounded frog . They cast 70-90 feet, always land on their belly with the eyes just above the water and they can be twitched, skittered or \"walk the dog\". Hook is down in the conventional position. This means you keep more of the fish that strike.","category":"Kits","thumb_url":"http://panthermartin.com/img/Small/FRG3.jpg","image_url":"http://panthermartin.com/img/Medium/FRG3.jpg","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=154933&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=855&tt=df","retail_price":"13.69","sale_price":"13.69","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=154933&amp;pri=855\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=1197&amp;sku=FRG3__&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","google_categorization":"Sporting Goods > Outdoor Recreation > Fishing > Fishing Lures","variants":{"":{"retail_price":"13.69"}}}
