{"sku":"DV36__","product_name":"Deadly 36 Deluxe Vivif Kit","long_description":"An assortment of 36 deadly Panther Martin Vivifs. This selection includes larger size Vivifs, including our Double Trouble 9\" Vivifs. Recommended for salt water fishing. Featuring eyelets at the mouth (rather than above the eyes) our Vivif Swimbaits swim better and truer than other swimbaits. These swimbaits are also heavier size for size than other swimbaits. This allows them to be cast further and go down deeper, even when being trolled. The vivid eye-popping holographic colors attract all species of fish from afar. The super sharp, long shank Mustad UltraPoint Hooks insure that fish stay caught. Comes with Crave Bait Gravy Scent and a very large re-usable tackle box with handle.","category":"Kits","thumb_url":"http://panthermartin.com/img/Small/DV36.jpg","image_url":"http://panthermartin.com/img/Medium/DV36.jpg","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=154933&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=851&tt=df","retail_price":"50.49","sale_price":"50.49","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=154933&amp;pri=851\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=1197&amp;sku=DV36__&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","google_categorization":"Sporting Goods > Outdoor Recreation > Fishing > Fishing Lures","variants":{"":{"retail_price":"50.49"}}}
