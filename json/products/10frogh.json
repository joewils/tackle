{"sku":"10FROGH__","product_name":"10 PK Holographic Frog Kit","long_description":"A selection of great Panther Martin Classic Holographic Superior Frog and Big Eyed Pro Frog colors in 3/8 and 5/8 oz. sizes. These surface high density frog lures are truly deadly on bass and pike. They cast 70-90 feet, always land on their belly with the eyes just above the water and they can be twitched, skittered or \"walk the dog\". Hook is down in the conventional position. This means you keep more of the fish that strike. Comes in a large re-usable tackle box that conveniently holds these great lures.","category":"Kits","thumb_url":"http://panthermartin.com/img/Small/10FROGH.jpg","image_url":"http://panthermartin.com/img/Medium/10FROGH.jpg","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=154933&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=811&tt=df","retail_price":"31.49","sale_price":"31.49","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=154933&amp;pri=811\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=1197&amp;sku=10FROGH__&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","google_categorization":"Sporting Goods > Outdoor Recreation > Fishing > Fishing Lures","variants":{"":{"retail_price":"31.49"}}}
