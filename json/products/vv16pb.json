{"sku":"VV_16_PB","product_name":"Pearl Black Vivif Double Trouble","long_description":"These \"Double Trouble\" Vivifs are unique in several ways: They feature eye-popping, holographic colors that drive salt water fish crazy! The 2 eyelets allow 2 different fishing actions: a true swimbait trolling action from the eyelet above the mouth and a true jigging action from the eyelet above the eyes. The 2 Mustad hooks insure that \"tail hungry\" fish get a mouthful that keeps them caught. The 2 dorsal fins stabilize the swimming action and make these Vivifs run straight and true just like real live shad minnows. Stupendously effective on super large offshore and inland stripers and many other species.","category":"9\" Vivif Double Trouble","thumb_url":"http://panthermartin.com/img/Small/VV16_PB.jpg","image_url":"http://panthermartin.com/img/Medium/VV16_PB.jpg","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=154933&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=795&tt=df","retail_price":"10.49","sale_price":"5.24","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=154933&amp;pri=795\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=1197&amp;sku=VV_16_PB&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","google_categorization":"Sporting Goods > Outdoor Recreation > Fishing > Fishing Lures","variants":{"":{"size":"6.9 oz.","retail_price":"10.49"}}}
